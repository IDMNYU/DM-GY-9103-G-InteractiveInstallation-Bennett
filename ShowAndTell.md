###Show & Tell

In the first week, you will either volunteer or be assigned to 2 people from the list below. On the assigned date, bring in 2-3 examples each person/group’s of their work. Each date has at least 2 people/groups. Be familiar with a brief bio and be prepared to critically discuss/analyze the assigned individual and their supporting work in a dynamic presentation in front of the class. Do not be lame. Be informed.

Create a Keynote, Powerpoint or Google Drive presentation. Prepare the presentation to be 10-15 minutes TOTAL. After your presentation, upload your presentation after exporting it as a PDF.
