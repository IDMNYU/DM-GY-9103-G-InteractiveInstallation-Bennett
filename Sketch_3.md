## Sketch 3

*Due April 17th: code to your GitHub repo, images + video documenting the interaction and output to your process blog*

Review the physical computing material covered in last class. 

After doing that, create a sketch that uses an input sensor to control a motor (inside your kit). Structure your arduino code to have 3 input states which map to 3 different output states of your motor. Perhaps your motor rotates a quarter to the right under one condition, another quarter to the right on a different condition, a quarter to the left on another condition or 180 under a different condition. Capture your input and store it in a variable. Run checks on that variable to see what conditions it fits within.

Have fun and be playful. Practice good circuit techniques in building your project step by step. 

Can you program in a change that only happens once in a while?


Name your Github Repo "II_Sketch_3" and send me a link to it.
