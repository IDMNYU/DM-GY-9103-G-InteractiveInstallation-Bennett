###Weekly Workshops or Class Material



####Must haves for Switch Workshop

1. **[a bundle of aligator clip leads 12"](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1008)** is good. 

2. **LEDS**

	(5 minimum) LED's - T1 3/4, 5MM - What ever colors you want. See [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), [Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/), [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [All Electronics](http://www.allelectronics.com/)

	-OR-

 	(5 minimum) [sewable LED's](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1758) Search for your desired colors. These are good for soft circuits only. 

3. **Batteries**

 - CR2032 Lithium Coin Cell Batteries are good. 

 - Make sure you get a battery holder for it. [Example 1 - soft circuits](https://www.adafruit.com/products/653). [Example 2 - regular circuits](https://www.adafruit.com/products/783). [Example 3 - DIY soft circuits](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=5222). [Example 4 - DIY paper with conductive paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/make/paper-battery-holder-fold-holder/)

 - AA Batteries

 - [AA Battery holder](https://www.adafruit.com/products/770)

 - 9 Volt Battery

 - [9 Volt Battery snap](http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/bst-3/9-volt-battery-snap-3-leads/1.html)

4. **conductive materials**
	- [conductive tape thick](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1127)
	- [conductive tape thin](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1127)
	- [conductive thread](https://www.adafruit.com/products/641)
	- [conductive fabric](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1168) Also comes in knit and jersey. Keep in mind that this is for connections + traces ONLY, not for making your objects!
	- [conductive paint - NOT highly recommended](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1306)

5. **nonconductive materials**

  fabric (if you are sewing), cardboard, paper, things from the recycle bin, balloons, tubes, straws. Think cheap and around the house or dollar store

6. **connecting materials**: non-conductive thread, hot glue, string, scissors, [sewing needle threader](http://www.amazon.com/SINGER-3-Count-Needle-Threaders/dp/B009D0O6LM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457135624&sr=8-1&keywords=needle+threader), sewing needles [ex](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1285), [beeswax keeps threads from fraying](http://www.amazon.com/Eurotool-Strengthening-Conditioner-Quilting-Crafting/dp/B004HMT12U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1457135662&sr=8-3&keywords=sewing+wax)
