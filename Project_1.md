##Project 1: Transform a space. Create a space.
##In-class critique: Monday February 13. 6pm
## 10% of your Final Grade

## Materials: brown paper, painters tape, parcel string

Using only the materials provided and a location on the 8th floor of MAGNET transform or create a space. This is a space that the body can travel through or be within. Ultimately, your goal is to create an experience for the body, not an object. How is this experience for the viewer different at different locations in this space?

Consider how people currently move through the space. How could you change that? Play with scale. Play with texture. Play with openings.

Consider how you can manipulate the paper – layer it, crumble it, break it into pieces, burn it, write/paint on it, fold it, hang it, etc. It has a million affordances. 

The goal of this project is to begin thinking about a space and how to create space. Forget about technology or making something interactive. Object making tends to be easier than thinking about how to create spaces. This project challenges you to separate from those things, in order to think about space and scale. This class is all about creating work that takes over or is coupled with a space, not just objects & technology existing in a space/gallery.

Secure the space that you’d like to use. Let me know before the end of class on Feb 6th. 

You are required to document your project (video and image) and submit copies to me by Tuesday February 14th (via email and your collection). Title all of your documentation Project_1_name_shotName.jpg and Project_1_Name_shotName.mov


###Critical Aspects:

We share the MAGNET space with several other departments. Space can be tight. Don’t assume that a space will always be empty, just because it is empty when you see it. Many people work on this floor. Be mindful of that in your set-up and experiments. Don't assume that you work can just be present in the space for the entire duration. See me, Tammy or Denise (MAGNET floor managers) if you have a question or issue.

You may not block fire exits, exit signs or pathes of egress. You may not block light structures with paper, as the lights get hot. 

You may not use color, electronics, or sound. Work within the constraints of this assignment to explore the assignment particulars.

You may not use nails, glue, other tape or other mechanisms of adherence beyond the tape given or strings. NYU rents the floor and as a result, is a tenant of the space.

Projects that violate these terms will be removed and will be the responsibility of the student.

You are responsible for removing your project after the critique. It must be removed that evening. Work that is not removed by 11pm will recieve a 1/3 letter deduction for every 4 hours it remains in place after the critique.
