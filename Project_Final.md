## Project 3 - Final Project
## Interactive Installation

### 25% of your final grade (10% working prototype, 15% final critique)

### RoundTable discussion April 10th
### Working prototype April 24th
### Final Critique May 12th  6pm

The final projec is of your choosing. It must have a conceptual componenet, that is evident in your research. The impact of that research should be evident in your input, output or code. You must create and design the control system, as well as the media, inputs and outputs.

You must create an experience, that changes over time. Another way to look at it, is an experience that unfolds or one with different modes or behaviors. As a result, in addition to triggering output, it's also managing time and spawning events. As a result, this is a more sophisticated system with behaviors.

You must deciced whether the interaction is direct, or in-direct. You should be able to talk about the input and how you went about it, as well as how that method supports your concept. 

I expect you to dig deeper than that and to use this system to illustrate a concept. I am looking for a portfolio level piece here.

Your piece should use some form of networking - other computers, other applications + technologies - as well as some best pratices for maintence and upkeep. Your project must be stable enough to run without errors or stalling for a few hours.


If you are struggling with a concept, I suggest that you follow through with the prescribed sketches to play and to investigate what is possible with the various software and hardware techniques. I am *not* looking for utilization of all the techiques we've been looking at. Use some techniques that interest you whether that is physically or conceptually with regard to input and output. These sketches could be the building blocks to your project, which is then a deeper and more thorough investigation of these techniques with an articulated concept that is driving the process of creation.



Treat each element of your system different. Get each one technically working and working independently. Then, bring the various elements together to work.


### Deliverables for April 10th
• A post on your research system (ie blog, website, evernote, pinterest: titled “Development” with the following:

• Concept map/Word map of concepts and ideas that you are interested in exploring

• 3-7 different artists, designers, projects, theorists, writers, musicans, poets

• Use the [storyboard templates](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-GY-9103-G-InteractiveInstallation-Bennett/tree/master/storyboardTemplates) to sketch out what would happen over time in your piece. What changes? What causes those changes? 

• What is the system design? What is talking to what?

• What are the inputs and outputs to the piece?

• What spaces are you thinking of using?

• What will the media be in your piece? Collect it now!

• Initial pieces of code. (Remember to break things down into steps)





### Final Deliverables  
<ul>
<li>Concept in 3-6 sentences</li>
<li>Links to influences and similar works – both conceptual and technical</li>
<li>Final patch(es)</li>
<li>All media required for the final</li>
<li>Documentation of the final projects: Video and Images showcasing interaction timeline.</li>
<li>Documentation of things working: Video and Images showcasing development: circuits, working circuits, initial set-ups in space, physical items in those spaces </li>
<li>Sketches, including initial comic book and subsequent sketches</li>


<li> All of the above should be on your blog, with a link to your Github Repo for this project that includes all of your code and development code </li>
