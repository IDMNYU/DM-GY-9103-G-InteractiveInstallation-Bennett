##Sketch 1

Explore Processing's graphic, video and sound capabilities environments. Create a sketch that based on input (either mouse input, keyboard input or simple camera input), manipulates a sketch's graphics, video or sound. It must be evident how you crafted and bent examples to your will. I don't want to look at a canned example, or a canned example with some whip cream on top. Play. Explore. Experiment.
