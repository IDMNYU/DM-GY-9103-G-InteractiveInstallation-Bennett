##Sketch 1

Explore Processing's graphic, video and sound capabilities environments. Create a sketch that based on input (either mouse input, keyboard input or simple camera input), manipulates a sketch's graphics, video or sound. It must be evident how you crafted and bent examples to your will. I don't want to look at a canned example, or a canned example with some whip cream on top. Play. Explore. Experiment.



*Due Feb 27th via your GitHub repo*

Name your Github Repo "II_Sketch_1" and send me a link to it.

If you are unfamilar with Processing:

1. read the booklet in the resources channel of Slack: Getting Started with Processing.

2. Look over the [Github code examples from Shiffman's Learning Processing text](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing). Look over the basic examples and get a feeling for how keyboard + mouse interaction work.

3. Then, especially look through Chapters 15, 16, 20 example code. Chapter 15 is important as it covers pixel manipulation. Do read over this before our next class. His videos are fabulous supplemental videos that go over all of this in greater detail.

If you are familar with Processing:

1. Review chapter 15's code examples.

2. Read through and play with Chapter 16 + Chapter 20's code examples
