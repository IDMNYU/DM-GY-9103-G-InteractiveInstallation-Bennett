What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hand-on course, students will learn how to create interactive installations and environments. Scale and space will be explored with reference to the body, while creating cybernetic systems for real-time and time-based interaction. Software (p5.js, openCV, Max/MSP/Jitter), electronics and physical computing (Arduino) will be covered in a workshop style format, with the goal of students creating physical projects. A variety of input and output mechanisms (edge detection, tracking, capacitance sensors, presence sensors, custom switches, etc), networking and best practices will be covered in workshops. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive art and design, space, installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas/concepts through the lense of this course.

### Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program goals by

• Integrate multiple mediums of image, text, sound, physical, space, and interactivity. (Reinforced)

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition. 

• Combine research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration. (Reinforced)

• Collaborate across disciplines.

• Adopt and use professional practices. (Reinforced)

• Integrate Cultural Literacy

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.

### Objectives

Students will gain a vocabulary for interactivity and learn a variety of tools and techniques to create interactive installations, including tracking, edge detection, sensors, basic electronics and physical computing. Students will gain knowledge of different methods to create interactive installations including: installations for 1 person, many people, time dependent or input dependent. Students will understand the difference between reactive, interactive and dynamically changing systems. 

Students are expected to bring ideas to explore with these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful function of the technical process. The goal is to integrate these technical elements to make work that is about something. This could be a problem, phenomena, story, natural element, or other form of expression. This class is about exploring those on a physical scale, such as the body. Projects will create full scale and dynamic installation using both digital and physical means. These projects will be portfolio-level quality works.

###Pre-requisites

This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a super high degree of programming ability. I don't expect you to be familair with techniques and how to execute them technically. We'll cover those in the workshop. But I do expect you to be able to pick up the different programming and technical environments and to demonstrate research, problem solving, investigation and experimentation. I do expect you to explore these tools independently and to be making personal discoveries. 

Students are welcome to incorporate other programming they are familiar with for the Projects.

<dd>Project 3: Final Project: 25% (10% Prototype, 15% Final)</dd>
</dl>

**A.	100 – 90%**	Excellent, Outstanding, Superior
Performance, participation, attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands interactivity, has a developed and practically can create well-designed interactive installations.


**B.	89 – 80%**	Very Good / Good
Performance, participation, and attendance of student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of interactivity, yet not superior.


**C.	79 – 70%**	Satisfactory, OK, not bad
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of interactivity. Makes an avid attempt during the workshop and completes most of the workshops. Asks some questions in class, but a greater effort can be made to understand and apply the material. More time is needed to study, make, take risks and explore. Not pressing hard enough


**D.	69 – 63%**	Poor; Below Average
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many areas that show any understanding of interactivity. Minimal effort is being made on the students’ part. Problems include lack of interest, procrastination, and/or poor time management.


**F.	Below 62%**	Unacceptable
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. Work submissions are missing, either in parts or completely missing.

###Attendance
•	Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class

•	Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.

•	Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)

•	Unexcused absences will affect your grade

•	One absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 pts out of 100 for each additional absence.

###Participation

It’s imperative for you to be active in class – in discussion, research, and activity inside and outside of class. We are a community and your part is key, regardless of whether you may be struggling or not.

### Communication

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the github account for the class at twice a week for up to date information and demo code

• Consult the [Slack](https://iisp17.slack.com) channel 3 times a week for information and updates

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude


###Sketchbook & Evernote/Mural.ly
You must have some sort of evidence and collection of your ideas, research, steps and action. This is imperative. You must be organized and be able to show the development of your ideas and concepts. Also, you’ll need to be taking notes in some form during workshops and demos. Figure out some way to aggregate this information for your own sanity. Evernote is perfect for this. It collects and intakes… well, everything!


###Required Readings

We will be reading from other artists, designers, critics and engineers throughout the semester: Margaret Morse, Myron Krueger, Golan Levin, Roy Ascott, Jack Burnham, Francis Halsall, Ken Rinaldo, Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau, Gordan Pask, Soke Dinkla, among others.

Readings can either be found online with links in the calendar under homework, or supplied through the Slack Resources Channel for this class. Many are found in the text [*Systems* edited by Edward Shanken](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/systems).



###Technology in the Classroom

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. As a general rule, the following uses are unacceptable: checking e-mail, instant messaging, texting, using Facebook, Google+, Flickr, Instagram, or other social networking sites. The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation. In particular, give your fellow students the respect you deserve in return, and close your laptop and give them your full attention when they are presenting work. Otherwise, you will be requested to close your laptop/phone in order to give the class your full attention.
