##Project 2 - Cybernetic System
##Interactive Installation

### 20% of your final grade (5% prototype, 15% midterm)
### Due March 27th  6pm

Create an interactive system that exists in a space. This system should take input from the space and produce output that is based on that input. This system should take a variety of forms of inputs and create various outputs. Think of this different inputs and outputs as behaviors. Your system could be living, breathing and constantly changing. 


The critique will happen in physical space. It will not be you clicking an image on your laptop that is projected. The input and the output must have space inbetween, that is utilized conceptually.

This can be playful, deeply conceptual or an investigation of something. Craftsmanship is important in this piece, as it is not a simple technical exercise. This is not just about a successful technical interaction with software. I expect you to dig deeper than that and to use this system to illustrate a concept. I am looking for a portfolio level piece here.


If you are struggling with a concept, I suggest that you follow through with the prescribed sketches to play and to investigate what is possible with the various software and hardware techniques. I am *not* looking for utilization of all the techiques we've been looking at. Use some techniques that interest you whether that is physically or conceptually with regard to input and output. These sketches could be the building blocks to your project, which is then a deeper and more thorough investigation of these techniques with an articulated concept that is driving the process of creation.

Your outputs could be visual (graphics, video) or sonic. Your input's could utilize the camera as a sensor and/or physical sensors in the space.

Treat each element of your system different. Get each one technically working and working independently. Then, bring the various elements together to work.
